# About Me

I'm a software engineer focused on cross-chain infrastructure and stablecoin systems. Currently tech lead at Block (Cash App) working on stablecoin products. Previously led web infrastructure at Chainflip, a native-to-native cross-chain DEX that processed $5B+ in volume.

I co-organized Eth Melbourne for two years, hosting speakers from Paradigm, Nethermind, Railgun and others.

I write about settlement systems, orderflow dynamics, and the intersection of monetary policy and programmable money.

You can find me at [github](https://github.com/cdrn), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cdrn/) or email me at chrisdoran at protonmail dot com.

Here is a very cool picture of me with my [favourite statue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laoco%C3%B6n_and_His_Sons) (this was a big deal for me), which is also very cool.
