This is the third and final part unwinding the contract talk i gave at [eth melbourne](https://ethmelbourne.co/).You can find the first part [here](https://cdrn.github.io/blog/slurpingcontractdatapt1/) and the second part [here](https://cdrn.github.io/blog/slurpingcontractdatapt2/) In this part, I want to talk a bit about your options when trying to index contract data at any kind of scale
