I help out co-organising the Ethereum meet up in Melbourne along with a motley crew. The meetup covers non Eth topics (Bitcoin? Farcaster?) and is more a technical meetup for blockchain developers and enthusiasts. We've fielded speakers from paradigm, nethermind, railgun and others. I gave a few talks as well - one on blockchain indexers and another on the lightning network's flood and loot vuln.
