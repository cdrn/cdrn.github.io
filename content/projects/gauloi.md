Hacked out in anger over a few weekends with a good friend, we did some Eth <> BTC atomic swaps. We came up with a plan to try and create a decentralised orderbook for the swaps where they would be priced as options. The goal was to sidestep the pitfalls of traditional "collateralised multisig" approaches to cross chain exchange and create a more truly peer to peer ecosystem. Credit goes to 0x33a for persisting beyond reason with BDK and P2WSH.
